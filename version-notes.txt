  - Initial commit on GitHub

0.92b July 16th 2016
  corrected typo in constant.cc : iCPP instead of iCCP 

0.93 July 18th 2016
  - added zlib support + UTF8 output and some conversion from latin1 to utf8
    so now can decode zTXt and iTXt
  - partially cleaned the code

0.94 July 18th 2016
  - More debugging:
    - more reliable version number dealing,
    - replaced (unsigned) long int by (u)int32_t because on clang++ it was 8 bytes long instead of 4
  - Partial iCCP support

0.95 July 18th 2016
  - added more uint32_t, int32_t and uint16_t 

0.96 May 2nd 2021
- started modernising C++ code (still C++11)
  - decreased pointer use
  - all dynamic arrays became vectors (RAII)
  - remplaced FILE by ifstream (allows RAII)
  - in particular, no more new nor delete
  - redesigned myfread3 which became (slower but) system agnostic 
  - renamed myfread, myfread2 and myfread3
- removed some bugs
- added an option to hide IDAT chunks (there may be lots of short ones, bloating the output)
  and an option to hide text chunk contents
- added a count of IDAT chunks and of the total image data bytes (always visible)
- small output tweaks for a more pleasant use

0.961
- replaced &v[0] by v.data() where v are vectors

0.962
- corrected bugs in output of iTXt chunks
- VERSION macro is now a string

0.963
- Corrected bugs in handling of iTXt chunks

0.97
- can now dump color profile to a file (.icc), if the iCCP chunk is present, with the command line option -icc

Todo:
- Code cleanup : 
  - decrease further pointer use
  - replace use of cstring by more C++ equivalents
  - replace uint*_t by uint_least*_t or uint_fast*_t --or-- stop using them
  - there is a big problem on some (rare) systems: seekg and tellg do not necessarily count bytes, and do not necessarily start at 0
- interpret iCCP? The spec looks complicated
- in a previous version I noted: "some messages have no meaning if corresponding variable is undefined". What did I mean?
- more concise options
- cout output is utf8 only, may be a problem on Windows
